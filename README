# HoneyDo Tasting

## Why?

HoneyDo Tasting is the product of a creative Hackbright Academy assignment -- or more accurately: a fantastic opportunity to hone coding skills!
<br><br>

## What?

To support the fictitious need for users to schedule boutique melon-tasting experiences, HoneyDo uses a combination of technologies to allow users to register/log in, search for appointments on a given date within a specified range of times, book the appointment, and view a summary of all appointments the user has scheduled.
<br>

## How? (and why that how?)

HoneyDoâ€™s backend utilizes a PostgreSQL database that links two separate classes/tables for Users and Appointments. Details can be seen in the data architecture image below.
